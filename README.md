#Hackathon For Android Developers

###Problem Statement:

The year is 2050, we have 2 billion vehicles worldwide and 3 million deaths in road accidents annually. 
In 2013 we had ~1billion vehicles and 1.25 million deaths annually. 
Time has come when we take road safety seriously. 

Car-to-car communication (let's call it CarFi) is in advanced stage now and any car can share it's data like speed, position, acceleration, electronic stability, braking system health, collission data etc. with anybody over internet in real time. 

You are one of the excellent team member of this worldwide road safety program on a mission to save 3 million lives. 

Your job is to make a one page app for traffic control police to monitor cars using CarFi data.   

You need to do following

1. Design CarFi API data schema
2. Save sample data in https://www.jsonblob.com/new
3. Access the CarFi data from android app and save it in local database
4. A dashboard screen to show summary about one car's stats relevant for traffic polic

#####Instructions:
You need to show one page only for stats of a specific car. 

Keep CarFi API data minimal only as much as you need to show in dashboard.
 
#####For evaluation we will need
1. Screenshots of the app screen
2. Code, shared through your github or bitbucket repository


Happy coding!
